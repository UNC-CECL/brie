BRIE: The Barrier Inlet Environment model
=========================================

This is the python version of the BarrieR Inlet Envrionment (BRIE) model written
by Jaap Nienhuis and Jorge Lorenzo Trueba. The matlab to python conversion was
performed by Katherine Anarde. Eric Hutton worked to wrap the model with a basic
model interface, reorganized the many model components into classes (i.e., The
Alongshore Transporter), which now allows for dynamical testing of the alongshore
transporter model (see the Jupyter Notebook).
